About this Repository
===============================

Our society is becoming more and more health conscious, people are living longer - often past their 70’s.  Science can do amazing things to preserve and extend life through new cures to previously untreatable ailments and diseases. Therefore, the health industry is a huge and growing market with hospitals and health centers being built frequently to meet the needs of an ever-growing market.  Our customer, JKTW Health Center, is one of these establishments.  Due to ever-increasing demands, they have exceeded the capability to efficiently run their establishment.  Records are poorly secured, processes are typically manual, and their Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system is based on several fragmented systems.

We aim to improve the way staff at JKTW Health Center handle and view their customers’ records through a comprehensive and expandable software system.  In this way, we hope to lower clerical errors and bolster the customer experience when choosing their health provider.

This repository is for a system that will accept logins from hospital staff and allow them to edit and view patient records.
